Ralph,

   Let's start to talk about the overall design.

* What's the main purpose of the system (i.e., what
  are the expected applications and use cases)?

* Will it only run IPv6, or is there a need for a
  dual-stack approach?

* Should we view the system as a router or as a host
  on a single wireless network that happens to use
  low-level protocol software to relay packets.

* Will the system need to handle address/protocol
   translation (e.g., NAT or IPv6-IPv4)?

* Should the nodes try to find a path to the Internet
  or should they just among themselves?

Doug
