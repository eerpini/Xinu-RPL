    ETHER<-----------------------------------------------------------

* A boxed item denotes a process; other names correspond to functions.

* An item surrounded by stars is an interface with an input packet
    queue.  The Ethernet interface can be turned off if the node is
    not a border router.

* ETHER and RADIONET are the names of Xinu devices for the Ethernet
    side and 802.15.4 side.

* The rad_in (radio input) process continually reads incoming packets,
    collects fraglets, and reassembles a complete frame before
    enqueuing the frame on the interface queue.

* The ip_in process (one per interface) repeatedly extracts the next
    datagram and either delivers to the local stack, forwards, or
    makes a copy for the local stack and forwards (the last case
    is needed for a datagram that has been multicast to a network
    but arrives over another network).

* The rad_out process accepts an outgoing packet, divides it into a
    sequence of fraglets, and sends each fraglet.

* On the Ethernet side, there's no fragmentation, so the eth_out
    process may be unnecessary.  We should consider whether we could
    just have ip_forward write the packet to the ETHER device (i.e.,
    whether there is any benefit in  an output queue).

* ip_send is only called for outgoing IP datagrams that originate
    from local applications.  It handles loopback and datagrams sent
    to one of the local unicast addresses; it  passes other datagrams
    ip_forward.

* ip_forward accepts outgoing datagrams and enqueues them on one of two
    output queues.  It looks up the destination address and decides
    whether the datagram should go on the Ethernet queue or the 802.15
    queue.  If the interface is already filled in (e.g., the datagram
    is ping reply which must go back over the interface on which it
    arrived or an application has specified the interface to use),
    ip_forward does not check the destination address.  Otherwise,
    ip_forward uses the destination address to select an outgoing
    interface and fills in the IP source address accordingly.
