This code compiles and has been tested.

Currently the TTY driver is functional.

When plugging in the board, there are two devices showing up as /dev/USB0
and /dev/USB1, but after downloading the image, the /dev/USB0 will
disappear.

UART1 serial I/O appears as /dev/USB1 (Linux) in my workstation and can be
accessed through any terminal emulator (minicom).
