Spec questions:
* What addresses for PANA?


6.2.1	MAC configuration
A node that is administratively configured to form a new IEEE 802.15.4
PAN will perform the following steps.

***Note - this is method for *forming* a PAN
  
 * The node conducts a MAC energy detect scan on all the
   preconfigured channels and identifies channels with energy level below
   a configured threshold.
  * The node conducts a MAC active scan using the standard beacon
   request on the channels selected in the previous step. 
 * The node then selects a channel with the least number of existing
   IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
 * The node chooses a PAN identifier that does not conflict with any
   networks discovered in the previous steps and also configures a
   randomly generated 16-bit short address. 
 * The node starts an IEEE 802.15.4 PAN on the selected channel and
   PAN identifier.

ZIP spec join process:

Send beacon request - MAC command frame with Beacon Request
Beacon frame format
MHR (MAC header) (see fig 62)
MHR: 7 octets
FCF
DAM == 2
SAM == 0
Frame Pending, ACK Request, Security Enabled all set to 0
DST PANID = 0xffff
DST addr = 0xffff

FCF = 2 octets
Seq Num = 1 octet
DST PANID = 2 octets
DST addr = 2 octets

Active device sends beacon (can send beacon async?)


Node in network sends beacon
Payload: 
protocol ID == 2
control field == 1
network ID = "ZigBee IP"
appInfo - 0 bytes

Joining device receives beacon, extracts info and joins net

PANA exchange for network key
What addresses to use for network key?
