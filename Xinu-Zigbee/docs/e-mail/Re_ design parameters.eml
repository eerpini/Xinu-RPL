Wow, that's quite ambitious.

Is the mesh forwarding handled at the network level or through IP?
That is, should we think of the model as (A) where IP handles all
the forwarding, but uses interface 1 as a 1-arm router, or should
we think of it as (B) where IP sees two interfaces that correspond
to two networks and a separate layer handles the mesh forwarding?
